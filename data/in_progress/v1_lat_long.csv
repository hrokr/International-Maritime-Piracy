ReCAAP COMMENT:  Although there is no conclusive evidence as yet, it appears that the same group of pirates was probably involved in the two incidents that occurred in the South China Sea on 30 September 2008 and 2 October 2008.  The ReCAAP ISC notes that these were the fifth and sixth incidents that have occurred in the South China Sea area since January 2008.  Ship masters are advised to maintain vigilance with all around look-out as per established norms, and take security precautions when operating in the area especially during hours of darkness. They are encouraged to monitor all maritime safety information broadcasts for the area.  The ReCAAP ISC encourages ship owners and ship masters to report all incidents of piracy and armed robbery to the nearest coastal states immediately (ReCAAP).",PIRATES,CHEMICAL TANKER,XI,71

No sign of any weapons but the closest boat was seen to have a small hold type space with hatch removed. There was no sign of any fishing gear.  Security message was broadcasted to all ships via VHF chn. 16. Details of crafts and position given. UKMTO COMMENT: UKMTO called the vessel and discussed the incident at length with the master. The position of the vessel at the time of the boat activity was well north of any reported attack but was only 23NM off the Yemen coast in known fishing grounds. The master felt the vessels were not fishing because he judged them by European fishing habits rather than the local fishing techniques where the fisherman lay nets first then try to coral the fish (generally Tuna in this fashion) towards the nets. The item of note in the report though is the mobile phone. If the phone was analogue then it may be possible to get a signal to phone (and this may explain the man standing up in the bow whilst he tried to get higher for a signal) but it would still be extreme range. GSM phones would not have that range normally without refraction. The other alternative is a Thuraya sat phone or the like. This would be a very expensive luxury for a local fisherman so could suggest a spotting network for pirates. UKMTO are keeping an open mind on the incident and will watch for further trends (Operator, UKMTO).",PIRATE ATTACK,PRODUCT TANKER,VIII,63

Coalition warships, USS Roosevelt and HNLMS Zeven  Provencien, responded to distress calls but were unable to persuade the hijackers to release the vessel and broke off the pursuit out, of concern for the safety of the victims.  Abdi Garaad Daahir, a militia spokesman contacted by The Associated Press via two-way radio, said fighters from his clan had captured the vessel fishing illegally in Somalias territorial waters.  South Korea disputed this saying the pirates seized the vessel in international waters and later took it to Somalias waters.

UNCLOS also defines the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in UNCLOS, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of the Convention.

An IMB special alert dated 20 Dec reports the tanker lost contact with their vessel as of 19 Dec.  The tanker departed Palembang, Indonesia for Singapore on 18 Dec laden with 16,585 MT of vegetable oil.  Vessels last known location reported by the owner was 02-20N  106-41E at 0530 UTC, on 19 Dec.  ONI Comment:  In April of this year, pirates boarded a general cargo ship laden with tin ingot in Indonesian waters, forced the crew to take the vessel to a port in Malaysia and offload the cargo, before returning to Indonesian waters and releasing the vessel and crew unharmed.  The cargo was later found intact by Malaysian authorities in the same location it was offloaded.  In July, pirates boarded a tug and barge while awaiting berth in a port in Malaysia and siphoned approximately 3,500 MT of crude palm oil, into another product  tanker.  The Malaysian Marine Police found the product tanker and arrested the crew, while the Indonesian Navy Pursuit Team arrested five individuals believed to have perpetrated the theft.  In September, a general cargo vessel laden with 660 tons of tin ingot  was boarded by pirates, while underway off Indonesia.  The 14 crewmembers were set adrift in a fishing boat and landed safely on land.  The vessel was later discovered sunk not far from where it was hijacked and salvage divers assessed the cargo to be intact.   These incidents appear to represent a form of piracy not reported since Chinas crackdown on black-market activity starting in 1998, wherein a ship is targeted for seizure at its load port and the cargo is taken to some destination, where arrangements for disposal  have already been concluded.  The complexity of the operation suggests transnational players at the ship selection and cargo-disposal ends of the operation.  In these types of cases, crew and ship owner complicity must be considered, since they have no  immediate financial interest in the cargo, per se.  Since the crackdown on the illegal Chinese markets, hijackers have experienced difficulty disposing of their cargos.  If the STEADFAST is indeed hijacked and is not rapidly located and its cargo recovered, or  traced, this could be a sign that criminal gangs have solved their problem with disposal of stolen goods (IMB, ONI)",PIRATES,MERCHANT VESSEL,XI,71

However, no evidence of GAM involvement has been presented and it would be atypical for them so far offshore.  Although no source has mentioned the possibility, the incident could be the result of Indonesia's enforcement of its ban on passage of vessels near Aceh waters ""without proper permits"".

During the Rio Grande call on 17 and 18 August 94, the vessel was attacked twice. Please note that about 15 men, 2 armed, seemed     to know the interesting containers to be broken open. They kept the crew out of sight of the 'business areas' with guns, cut open the seals, opened the containers and threw their stealings over board in a small craft. When we are sure that the small craft is at a good distance we hope that intruders have left and start checking the containers/seals. The agent did his best for us, the vessel and the cargo and he called the police: but...but...but...was the answer.

At 2115, the duty officer sounded the general alarm after noticed suspicious activity on the forecastle. Officers and crew sent to investigate found the crewman assigned to patrol the area lying between the two forward hatches. He explained that he had been attacked by six to seven intruders during his rounds. During the attack, the intruders had broken both of his legs. Before leaving the vessel the attackers forced entry into the paint stores, from which they removed about forty liters of paint.  After repeated attempts to raise the shore officials on VHF, a launch finally arrived alongside the vessel to transport the injured crewman to a hospital. During the remainder of the night, it was not possible to contact the police or port authority via VHF.  Agents later advised the vessel's owners that the local ship agents association had appealed to the Federal Police to address the problem of attacks on vessels at Belem. The police have taken the position that until they are furnished with adequate communications equipment, such as walkie-talkies, they are not capable of taking effective measures.

The IMB has received a report from the Master of a tanker              attacked by armed pirates in Rio de Janeiro on the 22nd November       1992.                                                                                                                                         The vessel was loading at Rio de Janeiro DTSE/PP1 Sea Island. At       about 0300 hours local time, the jetty lights went out and she         was boarded by seven armed pirates from the seaward side.                                                                                     The pirates held the ship's duty watch in the Cargo Control Room       and forced the Second Officer, then on duty, to take them to the       Master's cabin. The pirates roused the Master from his sleep by        striking him with their guns and continued beating him as they         demanded cash from him. The Master gave them US $480 of his money      and regarding this as too small a sum, they began to                   systematically pillage the other cabins. By chance, in the course      of their search, the pirates found the ship's cash under an old        radio set and were furious, putting the Master and crew in fear        of their lives. After vandalizing the vessel they departed. The        attack lasted less than an hour and left the crew, with the            exception of the second officer, tied up and a total of US $7,800      and GRD 20,000 stolen.",assailants,merchant vessel,V,24
