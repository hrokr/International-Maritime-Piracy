Chinese fishermen are accused of attacking the coast  guard officer as he tried to board the Chinese vessel.  They hit him with a shovel and wooden stick and threw him into the sea, where he drowned.  The fishermen also used shovels and steel pipes to fight 17 other officers, injuring six of them.  Korean Coast Guard officials said yesterday that they have arrested 11 Chinese fishermen allegedly involved in the murder.  According to the Coast Guard, a patrol ship found the 17-ton Chinese fishing boat and ordered the crew to turn off the engine. Several officers boarded the fishing boat for an inspection.  The vessel was seized 62 miles northwest of the incident.  The deceased coast guardsman was found six kilometers south  of the scene, several hours after he was thrown overboard.  Coast Guard officials said that the unlicensed Chinese fishermen illegally entered Korea's exclusive economic zone. Unlicensed Chinese fishermen fiercely resist arrest because illegal boat owners operating without permission face fines up to tens of millions of won.  The Coast Guard and Korean fishermen say they are always in danger when they face Chinese boats in Korean waters, usually at night. (LM: JoongAng Ilbo)",

The position of the vessel at the time of the boat activity was well north of any reported attack but was only 23NM off the Yemen coast in known fishing grounds. The master felt the vessels were not fishing because he judged them by European fishing habits rather than the local fishing techniques where the fisherman lay nets first then try to coral the fish (generally Tuna in this fashion) towards the nets. The item of note in the report though is the mobile phone. If the phone was analogue then it may be possible to get a signal to phone (and this may explain the man standing up in the bow whilst he tried to get higher for a signal) but it would still be extreme range. GSM phones would not have that range normally without refraction. The other alternative is a Thuraya sat phone or the like. This would be a very expensive luxury for a local fisherman so could suggest a spotting network for pirates.

Reportedly, the ship's name was changed to EKA and the hull was repainted.  Upon arrival in Sandakan, the vessel had all required marine documents. Piracy was eventually detected, and eleven men suspected of involvement in the hijacking were arrested. Five of the arrested men were members of the tanker's crew. Eight other BLUE OCEAN-7 crewmembers were detained by Malaysian marine police in Sandakan after receiving the tip-off. The whereabouts of the tanker's captain is still unknown.",

The distress call was reportedly made by a local agent of a fishing vessel known as LIAN RUN 24, which is licensed to operating in Sierra Leones EEZ.  The Sierra Leone Armed Forces Maritime Wing promptly responded to the distress call and apprehended eight Guinean nations and their speedboat, while another speedboat was said to have  fled the scene.  Of the eight suspects arrested under the alleged act of piracy, two were reportedly lieutenants of the Guinean armed forces (one from the navy and another from the army) and two fisheries inspectors.  Aboard the seized speedboat, authorities report finding two AK-47 rifles, eight pistols, three magazines with 55 round of ammunition and one bayonet.  Guinean authorities rejected the piracy charge, saying the men were on a legitimate fisheries protection patrol.  Guineas navy said the military personnel were accompanying inspectors from the countrys National Fisheries Surveillance Center.  The matter has been referred to Sierra Leones Criminal Investigative Division and the local authorities are in contact with the Guinean Embassy in Sierra Leone.  ONI Comment:  It should be noted that on 06 Apr 2006 in an area 200 miles SW of Guinea Bissau, a fishing vessel named LIAN RUN 24 was reportedly documented by GREENPEACE as transshipping fish believed to be harvested in the Guinean EEZ to a reefer named BINAR 4. At the time, the LIAN RUN 24 was licensed to fish in Guineas EEZ but is required by Guinean law to offload all harvested resources in Conakry, making the observed transshipment illegal.  The line between resource protection and piracy is often blurry and  continues to be a source of contention between many littoral nations (REUTERS, LM: Angola Press, Awareness Times, GREENPEACE, ONI).",

According to the defense ministry, a distress message from the ship saying it was under armed pirate attack, was received by the Maritime Rescuing Coordinating Center in Falmouth, Britain and this had been relayed to naval authorities in Sri Lanka. The defense ministry also said the ship's local agents had sent a tug to prevent the ship from drifting to shore, but there was no word on whether the tug had reached the area or was permitted access by the Sea Tigers.  The government accused the LTTE of being in ""clear violation of international maritime law"" and said there was an act of ""armed piracy.""  Diplomats said that given food shortages in rebel-held areas of Sri Lanka, the rice cargo would be an attractive prize (AFP).",

The Taiwanese fishing boat  (HSING LONG), sailing near the Japanese Volcano Islands, has lost contact with the Taiwanese authorities and is believed to be hijacked by members of the crew.  According to Foreign Affairs spokesperson Michel Lu, the crew members included two Taiwanese men, the captain and the chief engineer, and eight mainland Chinese fishermen.  Media reports indicated the Japanese authorities intercepted a distress call on 10 June, alerted the Taiwanese authorities, and sent a team of investigators to look for the boat.  Lu stated that the captain was reportedly murdered on the afternoon of 10 Jun and the Japanese authorities are monitoring the boats movements.  Lu explained Japanese authorities have no legal jurisdiction over the case and will hand the case over to the Taiwanese Coast Guard at an appropriate time.  According to Lu, the Coast Guard Administration Officials have sent two vessels into Taiwans economic sea zone [seas on the border between Taiwan and Japan].  Also, a large warship (HEHSING) has been sent  to intercept the (HSING LONG), which has special agents and criminal police armed with the necessary weapons and equipment to handle the matter.  It is anticipated that the warship will make contact with the HSING LONG in two to three days, per 12 Jun reporting.  According to the fishing association, the (HSING LONG) had been taken over once before by another group of Chinese crew members three years ago (LM).",

The others reportedly identified themselves as members of the Bantay Dagat, with one claiming to be a policeman. Provincial Police Chief Charles Calima stated this ploy is their modus operandi.

Coalition warships, USS Roosevelt and HNLMS Zeven  Provencien, responded to distress calls but were unable to persuade the hijackers to release the vessel and broke off the pursuit out, of concern for the safety of the victims.  Abdi Garaad Daahir, a militia spokesman contacted by The Associated Press via two-way radio, said fighters from his clan had captured the vessel fishing illegally in Somalias territorial waters.  South Korea disputed this saying the pirates seized the vessel in international waters and later took it to Somalias waters.

UNCLOS also defines the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in UNCLOS, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of the Convention.

An IMB special alert dated 20 Dec reports the tanker lost contact with their vessel as of 19 Dec.  The tanker departed Palembang, Indonesia for Singapore on 18 Dec laden with 16,585 MT of vegetable oil.  Vessels last known location reported by the owner was 02-20N  106-41E at 0530 UTC, on 19 Dec.  ONI Comment:  In April of this year, pirates boarded a general cargo ship laden with tin ingot in Indonesian waters, forced the crew to take the vessel to a port in Malaysia and offload the cargo, before returning to Indonesian waters and releasing the vessel and crew unharmed.  The cargo was later found intact by Malaysian authorities in the same location it was offloaded.  In July, pirates boarded a tug and barge while awaiting berth in a port in Malaysia and siphoned approximately 3,500 MT of crude palm oil, into another product  tanker.  The Malaysian Marine Police found the product tanker and arrested the crew, while the Indonesian Navy Pursuit Team arrested five individuals believed to have perpetrated the theft.  In September, a general cargo vessel laden with 660 tons of tin ingot  was boarded by pirates, while underway off Indonesia.  The 14 crewmembers were set adrift in a fishing boat and landed safely on land.  The vessel was later discovered sunk not far from where it was hijacked and salvage divers assessed the cargo to be intact.   These incidents appear to represent a form of piracy not reported since Chinas crackdown on black-market activity starting in 1998, wherein a ship is targeted for seizure at its load port and the cargo is taken to some destination, where arrangements for disposal  have already been concluded.  The complexity of the operation suggests transnational players at the ship selection and cargo-disposal ends of the operation.  In these types of cases, crew and ship owner complicity must be considered, since they have no  immediate financial interest in the cargo, per se.  Since the crackdown on the illegal Chinese markets, hijackers have experienced difficulty disposing of their cargos.  If the STEADFAST is indeed hijacked and is not rapidly located and its cargo recovered, or  traced, this could be a sign that criminal gangs have solved their problem with disposal of stolen goods (IMB, ONI)",

After about 45 minutes a second, similar boat, joined the chase which ended after two hours.  The IMB and others have been quick to speculate that this incident somehow involves the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), who are seen to be desperate for sources of income and supply during the current Indonesian crackdown. However, no evidence of GAM involvement has been presented and it would be atypical for them so far offshore.  Although no source has mentioned the possibility, the incident could be the result of Indonesia's enforcement of its ban on passage of vessels near Aceh waters ""without proper permits"".  The vessels may have been Indonesian government craft which were declared on 4 Jun to have permission to open fire on any suspicious vessel.  The description that they were disguised as offshore oil support craft remains unexplained (IMB, INFO, LM, ONI).",

Hostage taking has been common in other similar incidents involving the Nigerian oil industry and foreign employees related to labor and revenue sharing issues between the Nigerian government and local tribes.  While ransom payments have probably been made in the past, it is unusual, and possibly precedent-setting, for the operator to have publicized the payment  - possibly in response to Danish media criticism.  BIMCO and the IMB are quoted as supporting the decision to pay ransom in this case.  No official support has been given to the decision to publicize the payment which is almost certain to generate further  hostage takings for ransom. (BIMCO, IMB, INFO, ONI).",

Although this and the preceding incident are reported as attempted piracy it is unusual for pirates to attack the ship using firearms prior to gaining access (for which they usually rely on stealth) and also unusual to use a boat with a flashing light as an attack platform. Circumstances suggest an encounter with an unidentified police or customs launch; the reason for the gunfire and lack of communication attempts remaining unknown.",

Seven or eight persons wearing hoods boarded the yacht late at night after the crew had returned from dinner ashore.  On  8 Dec Brazilian police reported they had arrested seven men in the death and that four had confessed to the robbery and shooting claiming they had shot Blake twice in the back in self-defense.  Blake was ending a tour to heighten environmental awareness in the  Amazon region and had reported death threats earlier in his expedition.  All concerned appear to be handling the case as one of robbery and murder without making any connection to Blake's environmental activity.

The incident reportedly occurred 224 km north east of Singapore when a vessel ""disguised"" as an Indonesian naval unit forced the fishing vessel to stop when persons dressed in Indonesian uniforms boarded.  There is no report of damage or other loss and no other crew member was reported injured.  Fishing vessels frequently carry arms such as shotguns to protect nets and catch against poachers and master may have been shot defending his boat.  Since attack was presumably mounted in daylight and nothing was taken from the fishing boat, piracy is not automatically suspected in the incident.  Since crew of the attacking vessel wore Indonesia uniforms and vessel appeared to be an Indonesian naval unit it is  assessed that the incident is more likely related to continuing unrest in the Indonesia Archipelago and Indonesian Government attempts to curtail seaborne infiltration of supporters of private militias.",

At 2115, the duty officer sounded the general alarm after noticed suspicious activity on the forecastle. Officers and crew sent to investigate found the crewman assigned to patrol the area lying between the two forward hatches. He explained that he had been attacked by six to seven intruders during his rounds. During the attack, the intruders had broken both of his legs. Before leaving the vessel the attackers forced entry into the paint stores, from which they removed about forty liters of paint.  After repeated attempts to raise the shore officials on VHF, a launch finally arrived alongside the vessel to transport the injured crewman to a hospital. During the remainder of the night, it was not possible to contact the police or port authority via VHF.  Agents later advised the vessel's owners that the local ship agents association had appealed to the Federal Police to address the problem of attacks on vessels at Belem. The police have taken the position that until they are furnished with adequate communications equipment, such as walkie-talkies, they are not capable of taking effective measures. The police maintain that a local gang known as the Water Rat is behind the attacks. The gang has now been active at the port for over two years, and has reportedly become better organized and more violent over time.",

Three minutes later, four to five men were sighted on the main         deck near the forward hatch. In an attempt to frighten the             intruders off the vessel the main alarm and whistle were sounded,      the deck lights were repeatedly switched on and off, and the crew      was called on deck. Vessels nearby were warned of the presence of      the attackers on VHF CH 16. By 0314 the intruders were seen            departing the vessel into their boat, which headed for the             breakwater entrance.  The boat was tracked by vessels' radar and       seen entering the breakwater at 0330 hrs.

The vessel was loading at Rio de Janeiro DTSE/PP1 Sea Island. At       about 0300 hours local time, the jetty lights went out and she         was boarded by seven armed pirates from the seaward side.                                                                                     The pirates held the ship's duty watch in the Cargo Control Room       and forced the Second Officer, then on duty, to take them to the       Master's cabin. The pirates roused the Master from his sleep by        striking him with their guns and continued beating him as they         demanded cash from him. The Master gave them US $480 of his money      and regarding this as too small a sum, they began to                   systematically pillage the other cabins. By chance, in the course      of their search, the pirates found the ship's cash under an old        radio set and were furious, putting the Master and crew in fear        of their lives. After vandalizing the vessel they departed. The        attack lasted less than an hour and left the crew, with the            exception of the second officer, tied up and a total of US $7,800      and GRD 20,000 stolen.",
